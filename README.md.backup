## Intro
I'm reading `Joy Of Code`'s blog and GH pages: @[https://github.com/mattcroat/joy-of-code/](https://github.com/mattcroat/joy-of-code/) taking notes on the organizational structure of things to learn from this project how to better organize and structure my own SvelteKit projects. In this case specifically a We(B)log.

**NOTES**

These are some notes on the structure of the project.

_Overview_



Both `data` and `posts` directories exist in the `project root` folder outside of the `/src` directory.

- The `posts` directory is managed directly on GH pages as GH is used  directly as a CMS, while the actual *App* is deployed On Vercel

- The `data` directory has a single `posts.json` file which stores all of the *metdata* related to all of the posts.

```
 Sample of posts.json
 [
  {
    "views": 730,
    "title": "How Code Sandboxes Update Content",
    "description": "How do code sandboxes update the iframe without causing flashing?",
    "slug": "avoid-flashing-iframe",
    "published": "2021-9-29",
    "category": "javascript"
   },
   {
    ...
   }
  ]
  ```

The only other *special* folder outside of those would be the 
`/src/lib/*` folder where namely an `api` folders exists along wither other folders that handle different parts of the app. Here we will
mainly focus on these folders for

*My Notes*

_dynamic pages_
- these work by adding a folder with braces around it like `/routes/blog/[slug]`, or [anyNameYouLikeHere]
- define +page.svelte and +page.js files in the [slug] folder.
- within the `/routes/blog/` folder add any sibling folders along with a corresponding +page.svelte file within
  to create a dynamic path with that new folders name
